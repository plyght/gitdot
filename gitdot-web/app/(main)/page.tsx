            A better GitHub. <br />
            An opinionated tool for quality open-source software.

          <p>
            Open-source maintainers. <br />
            People who see code as more than a means to an end, but as a craft
            to perfect. The software they build serves the world &mdash; but the
            software they use doesn&apos;t serve them.

            3. What problem does gitdot solve?
          </p>
          <p>
            A monopoly. <br />
            Open-source software only has one competitive platform: GitHub. And
            while GitHub <i>is</i> an impressive product, we also know that a
            lack of competition enables degradation over time. There&apos;s a
            few pain points we&apos;re keenly aware of (e.g., CI) and make it
            our mission to build a better open-source alternative.

            4. What features will gitdot have?
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-2">
            <li>• A hyper-performant Git server written in Rust.</li>
            <li>
              • A sane CI/CD platform that is secure by design and locally
              testable.
            </li>
            <li>
              • An issue tracker designed to serve the maintainer, not the
              submitter.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will not have feature parity, but from the get go, our product
            will be reliable. <br />
            It will stink of quality &mdash; and deliver a superior experience
            for a handful of customers.

          <ul className="mb-2">
            <li>• No AI copilot.</li>
            <li>• No vanity stars.</li>
            <li>• No free private repos.</li>
          </ul>
          We view AI as an implementation detail, not as a feature. We also
          question some of the paradigms present in open-source and ask whether
          features like stars truly serve the maintainer. And finally, public
          repos will be free, but private repos will be paid for.

          <p>
            Jun 1st, 2026. <br />
            Every week, we will publish a developer log to detail not only our
            progress, but our thinking in full. These will be strikingly
            forthright; we want the <i>why</i> behind our product decisions to
            be critiqued and understood.
          </p>

        <p>
          We recognize that we&apos;re making some bold claims here and
          we&apos;re not so naive as to think this will be easy. Building
          software is hard &mdash; but it is simply what we love doing.
