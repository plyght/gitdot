        <p>
          A better GitHub. <br />A home for great open-source software.

        <p className="font-bold text-lg">2. Who is gitdot for?</p>
        <p>
          Developers. <br />
          People who care. People who see code as more than a means to an end,
          but as a craft to perfect. <br />
          People who build software <i>well</i> — not because it is the optimal
          thing to do, but because it is the <i>right</i> thing to do.

        <p className="font-bold text-lg">3. What problem does gitdot solve?</p>
        <p>
          Quality. <br />
          Open-source software only has one competitive platform: GitHub. And
          while GitHub <i>is</i> an impressive product, we also know that a lack
          of competition enables degradation over time. There’s a few pain
          points we’re keenly aware of (e.g., CI) and make it our mission to
          build a better alternative.

        <p className="font-bold text-lg">4. What features will gitdot have?</p>
        <ul className="mb-2">
          <li>• A hyper-performant Git server written in Rust.</li>
          <li>• A code review tool that uses stacked diffs as primitive</li>
          <li>
            • A sane CI/CD platform that is secure by design, locally testable
            and reproducible
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We think things could be a lot better — and we want to release
          features that we’re proud of. <br />
          That does mean that things will take time, as building software right
          is still hard, but we do think you’ll find it worth it.

          5. What features will gitdot not have?
        </p>
        <p>
          AI. <br />
          We view AI as an implementation detail — and do not think that using
          it is necessarily good. <br />
          In fact, we think it makes many products worse by acting as a bandaid
          for poor design. <br />
          That isn’t to say we are blind to it, but that we will be judicious in
          our use of it instead.

        <p className="font-bold text-lg">7. How does gitdot make money?</p>
        <p>
          We don't. <br />
          We are fortunate enough to have raised a small pre-seed round from
          investors we are happy to call friends, and also to be at a point in
          our lives where we are financially independent and in good health.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          But it is our intention to build a business that lasts. <br />
          And we will be unabashed in looking for honest and sustainable ways to
          profit. <br />
          As of now, all repositories are free, but we do envision charging for
          private repositories for teams in the future.

          8. Does gitdot sell or train on my data?
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not. <br />
          There are fewer things lamer than selling data for profit. <br />
          Your code is your own and there should not be a thing to say
          otherwise. <br /> <br />

        <p className="font-bold text-lg">9. Is gitdot open source?</p>
        <p>
          Yes. gitdot uses the Apache License. <br />
          We are committed to open-source, but also do acknowledge the fear of a
          rug pull or a license change in the future. We know that we cannot
          assuage that anxiety with our words alone: trust is earned, it is not
          given. <br />
          <br />
          But we do ask that you hold us accountable: to critique us if we
          misstep and to fork us if you must.

          As engineers, we are painfully aware of our own inadequacies. <br />
          Building gitdot has made it obviously clear that there is much to
          learn and to improve still. <br />
          Yet, it is our hope that in some small way, these docs are our
          opportunity to give back.
